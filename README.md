<h5> Queue is a prototype that I built in my participation with my friend as a team in Covid-19 Homathon organized by https://safcsp.org.sa/ in 2020. :ant:</h5>
<h5> The idea was about organizing the people who want to visit any stores to be in a virtual queue that will limit the number of people inside any store at any time </h5>
